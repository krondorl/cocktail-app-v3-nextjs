# Cocktail App v3

![Cocktail](doc_img/cocktails-64px.png "Cocktail")

The project can retrieve information about drinks and cocktails from [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).

There are two modules in this project:

- get a random cocktail on reload and on clicking
- search for a specific cocktail by name

This is a remake of my earlier [Cocktail App v2](https://github.com/krondorl/cocktail-app-v2).

## New version

Tech specs:
- built with **Next.js**, which is a meta framework for React
- **full stack TypeScript** and TypeScript React code
- API calls are now made with **fetch** instead of axios
